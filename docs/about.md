# 😄 Hey There! I'm Srikanth 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the DevOps universe!  
I'm a **cloud-loving, automation-obsessed, Kubernetes-tinkering** engineer who enjoys breaking things (and then fixing them better 😎).

## 🚀 What I Play With (a lot!)

- 🐳 **Docker & Kubernetes** – My favorite toys!
- ☁️ **Azure & AKS** – Where most of my adventures happen.
- 🧰 **Terraform, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps** – Automate *everything*!
- 🔐 **Certificates (DigiCert + Keyfactor)** – Yes, even SSL can be fun… sometimes.
- 📊 **ELK Stack & Observability** – I like knowing *why* things break 😂.
